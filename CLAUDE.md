# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Educational repository containing Jupyter notebooks that implement deep learning concepts from scratch. Notebooks are designed to run in Google Colab.

## Architecture

- Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are the primary code artifacts, each covering a specific deep learning concept
- `attention_from_scratch.ipynb` — Attention mechanism implementation from scratch

## Running Notebooks

Notebooks are intended to be run in Google Colab or locally with Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook
```

## Conventions

- Notebook naming: `<concept>_from_scratch.ipynb` for ground-up implementations
- Main branch: `main` (used for Colab badge links in README)
